Parasitism is the most frequent method of life; parasites make up more than half of all animal species. Parasites can be present in all animal species and can have a significant impact on human, domestic animal, and wildlife health. Parasitology is the study of parasitism. It is an interdisciplinary field that includes morphology, taxonomy, biology, behavior, life cycles, pathogenesis, epidemiology, ecology, physiology, biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, infection detection, immunology, and therapy.

Despite many advances in parasite treatment and control, infections continue to spread due to a variety of factors, including urbanization (crowding); more intensive farming systems, greater animal translocation, further land, and marine development, inadequate effluent disposal, parasite drug resistance, and vector insecticide resistance. 

The primarily investigated problem is malaria patientsâ€™ classification via Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and transfer Learning.
